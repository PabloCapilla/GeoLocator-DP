The metadata is critical for describing your dataset and making your record findable. The metadata associated with a GeoLocator DP are expressed in the `datapackage.json` file. It follows the [Data Package](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/) specifications together with [Movebank Study Attributes]([https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/studies-page#study_details]). Properties indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty).

We only require minimal metadata to be able to [upload the data on Zenodo](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/deposit/about-records/), [create a study page on Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/studies-page) or [Upload on GBIF](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/gbif-metadata-profile#metadata-elements), but we strongly encourage entering as many of the fields as possible.
